## Deployment

For a quick and easy deployment using `docker-compose` consider using the [Project Managment App Repo][app-repo].

For _advanced use cases_, or when `docker-compose` is unavailable, the UI may be either started using `docker` directly or even manually started.
This process is further described in the [Deployment Guide][deployment-guide].
